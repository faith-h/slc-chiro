        It may be the result of an injury or the everyday wear and tear of being active, but when your spine is out of alignment it can have a significant impact on your overall health.

          Our Draper chiropractor also works specifically with the "weekend warriors" â€” individuals who spend their weekends staying active.
          Being active is an important part of life, but for many people, sports and exercise can take a serious toll.
          Through our services, we can help you recover or remain in peak shape by implementing sports-specific conditioning and chiropractic services designed around you.
          Every person is unique and that is why we take our time during appointments. While many chiropractors simply adjust their clients and send them on your way, at Salt City Chiropractic Wellness Center we offer a more comprehensive and holistic form of care.
          Our approach includes focusing on exercise and nutrition so that your total health is addressed as a whole.
